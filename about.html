      My name is James Hardy, and I like to code! I am currently a student at DigiPen Institute of Technology
      where I am studying to get a bachelor of science in computer science. I grew up in a small town in Washington
      where the most interesting thing there was to do was feed the ducks at the courthouse's pond. My school was
      small (about 40 kids per grade), and the opportunities were even smaller. My school did not offer any 
      programming classes (except for one year, more on that later) and I had to learn how to do it all on my own.
      And that I did; over a few years, I taught myself how to code. I wasn't the greatest programmer in the world,
      but I didn't let that stop me.

    <p style= "font-size: 40px; margin-right: 35px; margin-left: 35px;">
      Eventually, I fell in love with programming so much that I just knew it was what I wanted to do for the
      rest of my life. When my senior year came around and all my friends were picking colleges, I wasn't really
      sure what to do. I knew programming was a passion of mine, but was it really something I could do for a job?
      Was there even a realistic way for me to pursue this? These questions brought me to my school's counselor  
      who helped me find the website for DigiPen. I submitted my application and was accepted! Now I live in Seattle,
      where I continue to go to DigiPen, make awesome games, and dream about the jobs that await me!
